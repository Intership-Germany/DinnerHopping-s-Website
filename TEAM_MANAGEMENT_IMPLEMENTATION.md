# Team Registration & Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Team Registration & Management System (Scenario B) for DinnerHopping events. The system allows users to register as teams of two, manage their participation, handle payments, and enables admins to monitor and resolve team-related issues.

## What Was Already Implemented

The repository already had substantial team functionality in place:

### Core Team Features (Pre-existing)
- ✅ Team registration endpoint (`POST /registrations/team`)
- ✅ Invitation of existing users by email
- ✅ Addition of external partners without accounts
- ✅ Kitchen and course selection validation
- ✅ Team payment integration (single €10 payment for 2 people)
- ✅ Team member cancellation flow
- ✅ Partner replacement functionality
- ✅ Team decline endpoints
- ✅ Email notifications for team invitations and cancellations
- ✅ Team dietary preference computation (Vegan > Vegetarian > Omnivore)
- ✅ Payment confirmation emails for teams
- ✅ Refund marking for cancelled registrations

## New Features Added

### 1. Admin Team Management Dashboard

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/public/admin-teams.html` (142 lines)
- `frontend/public/js/pages/admin-teams.js` (311 lines)

**Features:**
- Visual dashboard showing all teams with categorization:
  - **Complete**: All members active and paid
  - **Incomplete**: One member cancelled, needs replacement
  - **Faulty**: Both members cancelled after payment
  - **Pending**: Awaiting payment or confirmation
- Filtering by team status
- Statistics cards showing counts by category
- Event-based filtering
- Action buttons for bulk operations

### 2. Admin Backend Endpoints

**File Modified:**
- `backend/app/routers/admin.py` (+207 lines)

**New Endpoints:**

#### GET `/admin/teams/overview`
Lists all teams with categorization and detailed status information.

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "teams": [
    {
      "team_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      "event_id": "507f191e810c19729de860ea",
      "event_title": "Summer DinnerHopping 2024",
      "status": "pending",
      "category": "complete",
      "active_registrations": 2,
      "cancelled_registrations": 0,
      "paid_registrations": 2,
      "cooking_location": "creator",
      "course_preference": "starter",
      "team_diet": "vegetarian"
    }
  ],
  "total": 42,
  "complete": 35,
  "incomplete": 5,
  "faulty": 2,
  "pending": 0
}
```

#### POST `/admin/teams/send-incomplete-reminder`
Sends standardized reminder emails to all team creators with incomplete teams for a specific event.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "event_id": "507f191e810c19729de860ea"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "incomplete_teams_found": 5,
  "emails_sent": 5,
  "errors": []
}
```

#### POST `/admin/events/{event_id}/release-plans`
Sends final event plans to all paid participants for an event.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "participants_notified": 84,
  "total_paid": 84,
  "errors": []
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Notifications

**File Modified:**
- `backend/app/notifications.py` (+35 lines)

**New Functions:**
- `send_team_incomplete_reminder()`: Notifies team creator to find replacement
- `send_final_plan_released()`: Notifies participants that event schedule is ready

### 4. Allergy Data Synchronization

**File Modified:**
- `backend/app/routers/registrations.py` (+6 lines across multiple locations)

**Enhancement:**
Allergy information from user profiles is now automatically included in team member snapshots:
- Creator's allergies are synced from their profile
- Partner's allergies are synced (existing users) or captured (external partners)
- Allergies are preserved during partner replacement
- Available to event hosts and other team members

### 5. Email Template Definitions

**File Modified:**
- `backend/app/routers/admin.py` (email template defaults)

**New Templates Added:**
- `team_incomplete_reminder`: Reminder to find replacement partner
- `team_partner_cancelled`: Notification of partner cancellation
- `team_replacement`: Notification for replacement partner

### 6. Automated Tests

**File Created:**
- `backend/tests/test_team_management.py` (324 lines)

**Test Coverage:**
- Team overview categorization
- Incomplete team reminder sending
- Event plan release functionality
- Faulty team detection logic
- Email notification workflows

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Minimal Changes Philosophy
All modifications were surgical and additive - no existing functionality was removed or substantially modified. New features were added as separate endpoints and UI components.

### 2. Status Categorization
Teams are categorized automatically based on registration status:
```python
if team.status == 'incomplete':
    category = 'incomplete'
elif cancelled_count == 2 and paid_count >= 1:
    category = 'faulty'
elif active_count == 2 and paid_count >= 1:
    category = 'complete'
else:
    category = 'pending'
```

### 3. Email Templates
All emails use the template system for consistency and customizability. Admins can edit templates through the admin dashboard.

### 4. Allergy Handling
Allergies are stored as arrays in team member documents:
```python
{
  'type': 'user',
  'user_id': ObjectId('...'),
  'email': 'user@example.com',
  'diet': 'vegetarian',
  'allergies': ['nuts', 'shellfish']
}
```

## API Integration

### Frontend Integration
The admin dashboard uses the existing `window.dh.apiFetch()` helper for API calls:

```javascript
const res = await window.dh.apiFetch('/admin/teams/overview', {
  method: 'GET'
});
```

### Authentication
All admin endpoints require the `require_admin` dependency:
```python
@router.get('/teams/overview')
async def admin_teams_overview(event_id: str | None = None, _=Depends(require_admin)):
```

## Database Schema

### Team Document Structure
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  event_id: ObjectId,
  created_by_user_id: ObjectId,
  status: 'pending' | 'incomplete' | 'cancelled',
  members: [
    {
      type: 'user' | 'external',
      user_id: ObjectId,  // for type='user'
      email: string,
      name: string,  // for type='external'
      kitchen_available: boolean,
      main_course_possible: boolean,
      diet: 'omnivore' | 'vegetarian' | 'vegan',
      allergies: [string],
      gender: string,  // for type='external'
      field_of_study: string  // for type='external'
    }
  ],
  cooking_location: 'creator' | 'partner',
  course_preference: 'starter' | 'main' | 'dessert',
  team_diet: 'omnivore' | 'vegetarian' | 'vegan',
  created_at: ISODate,
  updated_at: ISODate
}
```

## User Workflows

### Team Creator Workflow
1. Navigate to registration page
2. Select "Team Registration"
3. Choose to invite existing user or external partner
4. System creates team and sends invitation
5. Make single payment for both members
6. If partner cancels, receive notification
7. Can replace partner or cancel team

### Partner Workflow
1. Receive invitation email
2. Click accept link (or decline link)
3. Review team details
4. Participate in event or decline

### Admin Workflow
1. Navigate to Team Management dashboard
2. Select event to monitor
3. View team status overview
4. Filter by incomplete/faulty teams
5. Send bulk reminders to incomplete teams
6. Release event plans when matching is complete

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The test suite validates:
- ✅ Team overview endpoint returns correct categorization
- ✅ Incomplete team reminders are sent to correct recipients
- ✅ Event plan release works for all paid participants
- ✅ Faulty teams (both cancelled after payment) are detected
- ✅ Email notifications contain correct information

### Running Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/test_team_management.py -v
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `BACKEND_BASE_URL`: For generating links in emails
- `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`: For generating plan view links

### Email Templates
Admins can customize all email templates through the admin dashboard at `/admin-email-templates.html`.

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Migration
No migration needed - new fields are optional and backward compatible.

### Frontend Deployment
Simply deploy the new HTML and JS files:
- `frontend/public/admin-teams.html`
- `frontend/public/js/pages/admin-teams.js`

Update navigation links in existing admin pages (already done).

### Backend Deployment
Deploy updated Python files:
- `backend/app/routers/admin.py`
- `backend/app/routers/registrations.py`
- `backend/app/notifications.py`

No breaking changes to existing endpoints.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Enhanced Team Registration UI**: Replace prompt-based registration with rich form UI
2. **Batch Refund Processing**: Admin workflow to process multiple refunds at once
3. **Team Chat Integration**: Pre-event messaging between team members
4. **Team History View**: Track all changes/replacements for audit purposes
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by dietary preferences, course selection, location
6. **Export Functionality**: Download team lists as CSV/Excel

### Performance Optimizations
- Add pagination for large team lists
- Cache team statistics
- Implement real-time updates via WebSocket
- Add database indexes on team_id and status fields
