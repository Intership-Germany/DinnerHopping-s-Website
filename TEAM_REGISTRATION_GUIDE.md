  "partner_external": {
    "name": "External Partner",
    "email": "external@example.com",
    "gender": "female",
    "dietary_preference": "vegetarian",

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Kitchen & Course Selection
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

Team creators select the cooking location and course.

**Code:**
```python
def compute_team_diet(diet1: str, diet2: str) -> str:
    diets = [d.lower() if d else 'omnivore' for d in [diet1, diet2]]
    if 'vegan' in diets:

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Team registration fails with "kitchen required"
**Solution:** Ensure at least one team member has `kitchen_available: true`

### Issue: Cannot select "Main Course"
**Solution:** Ensure the selected cooking location has `main_course_possible: true`

### Issue: Partner not receiving invitation email
**Solution:** 
1. Check SMTP configuration in backend
2. Check logs for email sending errors
3. Verify partner email address is correct
4. Check spam folder

### Issue: Team shows as "incomplete" but both members are active
**Solution:** Check registration statuses - one may have status other than 'paid'

### Issue: Cannot replace partner after cancellation
**Solution:** Ensure cancellation deadline hasn't passed (configured in event)
