## ðŸ”§ Common Issues

**"Kitchen required" error**
â†’ Ensure at least one member has `kitchen_available: true`

**"Main course not possible" error**
â†’ Selected location needs `main_course_possible: true`

**Partner not receiving email**
â†’ Check SMTP config, logs, and spam folder

**Cannot replace partner**
â†’ Check if cancellation deadline passed

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Auto-sync allergies** - User profile allergies automatically sync to team registration
2. **Deadline enforcement** - Cancellations blocked after event deadline
3. **Idempotent operations** - Safe to retry team creation/payment
4. **Transaction support** - Team + registrations created atomically when MongoDB supports it
5. **Email fallbacks** - System falls back to console logs if SMTP unavailable
